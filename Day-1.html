        <b>
            <p>It all started when I woke up at 4'o clock and got ready to go on a fantastic trip. Oops, I am sorry I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Abinav, Abinav L.D. Once we got out, Somu uncle called us and told us they were waiting near the Hyundai showroom. But we told them to continue, and we will catch up in Sasi uncle's house. We were 5 minutes late because my mom was busy organizing everything.</p>
            <p>
                At 4:30 AM, we reached Sasi uncle's house. And I saw Somu uncle and his family weren't there, so we waited for them, and they arrived at 4:32 AM. We chatted for 3 minutes, and Sasi uncle and his family joined us, and we continued our journey. We stopped at Oorvasi veg restaurant for breakfast. After that, we swapped our cars, and we took a break in Perumbalur. At 11'o clock, we reached Trichy to have lunch.
            </p>
            <p>Again we swapped our cars. All children were in my precious and gorgeous BMW. We went at 152 kilometres per hour in my car. They were so excited, but I was scared. At 4 PM, we reached Arulmigu Kallalagar Temple; we met Saro uncle and his family as we went inside. We went up the mountain. And we saw a small temple. We finished the first temple in 5 minutes, and again we climbed the mountain to reach the second temple. After that, we went down the mountain and saw a big temple. It was the main temple, and we saw a troop of monkeys fighting and stealing things from other people so we left all the valuables inside our car and at last, we saw an elephant. Me, My brother, Hashini and Harsith ran towards the elephant.
            </p>
            <p>After seeing the elephant, we went back to our rooms. We played monopoly for a very short time because Hashini's little brother Harshith was making funny jokes. I couldn't control my laughter, but Hashini told me not to laugh. LOL. Ritish tried an experiment to catch a ghost in the dark. But Harshith was screaming, and we couldn't see it. When it was 11 PM, we went to bed because tomorrow I had to wake up at 4'o clock in the morning and I will see you on day 2.
            </p>
