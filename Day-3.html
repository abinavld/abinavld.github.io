            <p>When I woke up at 4 AM, I was late again. So I got ready asap, and we were ready to go. As we got down from the lift, my monopoly accidentally fell, so Maduvarshan and I collected it ASAP. Hashini, Ritish and I were in Ritish's car Creta. After 1 hour 30 minutes, we reached the Tiruchendur temple. As we went inside, it was very crowded. OMG the crowd is even bigger than the Tirupati temple. We again saw an elephant it was very old. Meanwhile, Saro uncle tonsured his head.
            </p>
            <p>I was removing my slippers, then a priest came and told me that it would take 5 to 6 hours to complete it. But he said that It would take one hour if we went in quick darshan mode, so we chose the quick darshan. Before we went in, the priest told the boys to remove our shirts. I was soooo embarrassed that they would laugh at meðŸ˜«. As we went inside the police stopped us, but the priest pushed us in and stopped the policemen. The crowd was pushing and started to squeeze me and the others. We finished the darshan, and as we left Tiruchendhur. There was nothing to eat in Tiruchendhur. I was starving, and we travelled for some distance. Finally, we took a break near the Thoothukudi district. We had tender coconut, and after some time we reached Thoothukudi we had lunch there finally!. Me, Pranav, Bhaky, Hashini, Maduvarshan, Harshith and Ritish had Spicy noodles and Veg pulao.
            </p>
            <p>After we finished lunch we are on our way to the lovely island of Rameshwaram.It was so dark that I can't see the ocean I can only see the boats.While we reached our room there is so much traffic jam luckily my father took a shortcut and the road was so small that our car can't go there. Some uncles helped us to find the way back to our rooms we saw Abdul kalam's house along the way to our rooms.After we checked inn, we ate food, but the shop was very small. Suddenly my dad had an idea, and he told the others to go to the room, and he and his friends bought food for us. We ate noodles and fried rice it was very spicy that I would drink 5 cups of water. We saw tom and jerry movie together at 9:00 PM. At 10 PM, we went to bed because we were not planning to go to the temple, but we would see the gopuram, and I will see you on day-4.
