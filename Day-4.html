        <b>
            <p>This time I woke up at 5 AM. Everyone was getting ready. I was lucky to catch up, and I got ready in 5 minutes. We went to see the Rameshwaram temple. When we got there, there was no crowd, and we went inside, but the policeman stopped us because phones and shorts were not allowed. So we kept the phones in a locker for shorts. Sara uncle had an idea. He bought a dhoti from a nearby shop and told the others to wear dhoti. We went inside the temple, but the temple was without a rush. We finished the darshan in 10 minutes. But it took us half an hour to complete the Amman darshan. We ate breakfast in Guru mess at 8:00 AM. Before we went to Dhanushkodi we went to a small temple. It looked like the Mahabalipuram temple. We finished it in 5 minutes. We saw the Patti mess on the way, but it was closed. I was very disappointed but never mind, I have eaten a lot of fish fries before.
            </p>
            <p>We reached the DhanushKodi viewpoint, and I was sooooo excited, but when we came there, it was fully crowded. We went to the ocean, but the rocks were very slippery that I almost fell in one of them. After a very short time the police told us to go back. I was furious ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡, meanwhile we took a stylish group photo. We were on our way to the church that was destroyed by a super cyclone in 1964. It was fully made of coral rocks. I was surprised that I had never seen a building made of coral rocks. Next, my favourite thing about this whole trip is WATER SPORTS! Jolly. When we reached there, the Jetski was not working. I was very, very, very disappointed, but I still had kayaking. Maduvarshan and I were on the same kayak, Ritish was on a lonely kayak and Hashini, Bhakya Shri had no kayaks, but they swam in the ocean instead. I was kayaking for almost 30 minutes, then Harshith told me to share the kayak and told me to swim. I was a bit scared, But even though I went in. It was not that bad. I swam for 30 minutes, but my mom called me to go to the car. When I almost reached the shore, I saw a string ray. I was terrified, but my mom told me it was just a shadow. I got to the beach safely, I changed my clothes and let my old clothes dry, and we were on our way to Trichy. We ate lunch in SPL food plaza. We saw the Pamban bridge, and we went outside to see the beautiful ocean the wind was so strong that I couldn't stand steadily, so we went back to the car.
            </p>
            <p>I slept for a short time, and then I woke up when Saro uncle was filling diesel. After 2 hours we reached the hotel called President. We ate early dinner that day. But my stomach was full. I only ate some parotta and paneer 65, and we reached Karaikudi, where all the people are rich. While we were on our way, Maduvarshan's cute little brother Dhashan vomited heavily in Ritish's car. They got in Sasi uncle's car, and we continued our journey. We reached Trichy at 10:00 PM. Everyone got in their rooms, but my family and I stayed in my aunt's house. The bed was very cozy, and there was a big bathtub. I have to wake up early and see you on day-5(last day).
