            <p>Another day, another temple JK. I was ready to go to Srirangam temple, the largest temple in India. I was in my aunt's house, and we got ready in 20 minutes. We went to my friend's room, and they were still getting ready. We waited for 10 minutes, and they finally got ready. We are off to Srirangam temple YESSSS!. The crowd was very less, but it took us 1 hour 10 minutes to complete it because it is India's largest temple and in the world, it is no.3.And finally, we went to our last temple Thiruvanikaval temple. We finished it in 40 minutes. Then I heard Hashini called me to have a race but I lost because of my stupid jeansðŸ˜¡. We ate breakfast at my aunt's house, and I showed them their house. A few minutes later, they went to their rooms to pack their bags. We stayed there for some time. Meanwhile, Pranav and I took a bath in the bathtub. Then, we went to my uncle's grandmother house. There was a small boy whose name is also Abinav. We met them before at my aunt's wedding. We chatted with them for some time, and we left and said bye to my aunt, uncle and beautiful Dhanya.
            </p>
            <p>We again returned to the room, and we saw that all my friends were ready. We ate lunch at Kannappa restaurant in Trichy, and we went to a Kallanai dam before starting for Chennai. After 15 minutes, we said bye to Balu uncle. 20 minutes later, we took a break in a tea shop. (departure 5:10) I went to somu uncle's car with Maduvarshan. We stopped at a gas station, and Somu uncle was filling petrol where we saw a dead snake. I went closer, but I was scared. But Maduvarshan went even closer. I screamed and told Maduvarshan to stay away from it because I saw it move slightly. The men beat that one more time, and the snake was completely dead. Then I immediately took a photo to show proof. After 1 hour at 8:00 PM, we reached A2B in Ulundurpet. After finishing dinner, we all kids went to Creta and laughed for almost 2 hours. That's a world record.
            </p>
            <p>After 3 hours, we reached our first destination, Sasi uncle's home. We chatted for 5 minutes and said bye-bye to Sasi uncle and his family. 30 minutes later, we said bye to Sara uncle and his family. We spoke briefly for some time and said bye-bye to everyone. And our final destination was OUR HOME!. That was an amazing trip. I hope you guys liked my story. I will write more stories in HTML. And we will have a fantastic trip again in 3 months. See you next time.
