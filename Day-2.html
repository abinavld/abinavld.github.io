            <p>When we woke up at 4'o clock, I immediately got ready because I was the last person to get ready. We went to a beautiful Meenakshi Amman temple. This temple is huge, and it took us 2 to 3 hours to get around the temple. When we finished our breakfast, we went to our rooms. When I entered my room, I was surprised to see Sara uncle, Balu uncle and Sara uncle's family after a loooooong time. Sara uncle's family went for breakfast, and we were busy packing our bags and getting ready to go to Tirunelveli.
            </p>
            <p>We travelled again for 86 km, and we took a tea break in Kovilpatti. After 20 kms, we ate lunch at Saravana Bhavan. We ordered chapati for lunch LOL!. Before we went to Tirunelveli, we saw a mountain called Kazhugu malai. We climbed up the mountain, and I was the first to reach the top of the mountain. And we are here At my friend's gorgeous native Tirunelveli we went to Tirunelveli's famous Nellaiappar temple. It didn't take long to complete it, but I saw an elephant inside the temple. I gave 10 rupees to the elephant, and the elephant patted my head with its trunk.
            </p>
            <p>My friends and I were exhausted, so we went to our rooms. The hotel was beautiful, and I could stay there forever. I was very hungry after a long journey, so my dad and his friends bought parotta for dinner. After we finished eating, we played monopoly for 30 minutes. After that, we chatted for 5 minutes, and we went back to our rooms to sleep. Again I should wake up At 4 AM because we are going to another temple in Thiruchendur and I will see you on day-3.
            </p>
